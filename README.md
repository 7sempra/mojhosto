This is an attempt to bring Momir Basic and MoJhoSto Basic to paper form.

What are Momir Basic and MoJhoSto?
----------------------------------
They're online only formats for Magic: the Gathering. You can read more about them [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/multiplayer/12118_The_Momir_Basic_Primer.html) and [here](http://theexploration.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/revisiting-momir-basic/) and [here](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mojhostos/).

Why do this?
------------
Momir is fantastically fun, and we wanted a way to play during lunch.

Has anyone attempted this before?
---------------------------------
Yes! It turns out there are some very clever people out there who like Momir. You can read [about](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/20) [a](http://rockpaperdynamite.wordpress.com/2006/09/11/mbrl-momir-basic-real-life/) [few](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yucq8P7uGso) [different](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75842/18828378/Paper_Vig_on_your_Kitchen_Table) [attempts](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mattkranstuber-042012-momir-basic-cube/).

While awesome, none of these are really the full Momir experience. Using a fast mobile printer that works with mobile devices we're carrying around anyway has produced a better experience.

How does this differ from Momir on MTGO?
----------------------------------------
There are a few differences.

For starters, we have more control over what creatures are available, while Magic Online is limited to whatever cards are available online. So you can't get a [Forest Bear](http://magiccards.info/p3k/en/135.html) on MTGO!

Second, we've heard (but not confirmed) that Momir on MTGO selects creatures per printing, not per card name like this project. For example, at CMC=0, you're slightly more likely to get Ornithopter because it's been reprinted many times.

How can I make my own?
----------------------
You're certainly welcome to use this app, but I haven't tested this with any other printer. The printer we use is a [Star Micronics SM-S200](http://www.starmicronics.com/Printer/PrinterDesc.aspx?PageId=14&PrinterId=103), which you can get for around $200. You'll also need an android device. We used a [Nexus 7](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Nexus_7_16_GB?id=nexus_7_16gb) that's running Android 4.2.2. I've also tested it on my [Galaxy Nexus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus), and it works fine, but the interface was designed for the tablet.

What's all the stuff about "Magic"?
-----------------------------------
Magic: The Gathering is a wonderful collectable card game created, owned, and copyrighted by Wizards of the Coast. You can read more about it at [the Official MTG Website](http://wizards.com/Magic/Summoner/).

Where's the database file?
--------------------------
I'm not sure it would be a good idea to distribute an entire database of copyrighted and trademarked content. There's information on the wiki on what the database schema is.

What if I have more questions?
